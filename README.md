# App Opener
### Open custom combinations of apps with a single click  

Every time I turn on my computer, I open one of three combinations of apps: things for *school, content creation, or gaming*.  

With Windows 10 startup options I couldn't make different profiles, so I decided to take matters into my own hands with my first experience with Python and GUI development.

This is a **lightweight Tkinter GUI app using locally-saved CRUD profiles** of apps that you can open with a single click.  

**Main Screen:**

**The Profile Menu:**

Now, after hours of reading documentation and coding, I can save a few seconds every day... maybe that'll pay off within a few hundred years?
No regrets though, I learned a lot and other people can use this too.

#### How to run this app on startup for your Windows computer:
- Download the folder including appOpener.exe, and create a shortcut to appOpener.exe
- Open Run by pressing WindowsKey + r, or by searching for Run in the Windows search bar
- Type "shell:startup" and click OK
- Move a shortcut for appOpener.exe into the file explorer window that appears (the filepath should look like this: C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME_HERE\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)
