# App Opener
### Open custom combinations of apps with a single click  

Every time I turn on my computer, I open one of three combinations of apps: things for *school, studying, or gaming*.  

With Windows 10 startup options I couldn't make different profiles, so I decided to take matters into my own hands with my first experience with Python and GUI development.

This is a **lightweight Tkinter GUI app using locally-saved CRUD profiles** of apps that you can open with a single click.

Now, after hours of reading documentation and coding, I can save a few seconds every day... maybe that'll pay off within a few hundred years?
No regrets though, I learned a lot and other people can use this too :)
