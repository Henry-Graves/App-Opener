# App-Opener
Open custom combinations of apps with a single click using this Python GUI app.
Switch between different locally-saved CRUD profiles of apps to suit your needs.

Every time I turn on my computer, I open one of three combinations of apps. Things for school, studying, or gaming.
With Windows 10 startup options I couldn't make different profiles, so I decided to take matters into my own hands with my first experience with Python and GUI development.

Now, after hours of reading documentation and coding, I can save a few seconds every day... maybe that'll pay off within a few hundred years?
No regrets though, I learned a lot and other people can use this too :)
